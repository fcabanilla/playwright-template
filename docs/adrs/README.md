# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains the Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) for the Cinema Multi-Platform Test Automation Framework.

## What are ADRs?

Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) document important architecture decisions, the context in which they were made, and the consequences of those decisions. They help teams understand why certain choices were made and facilitate future architectural decisions.

## Format

All ADRs follow the template defined in [`_template.md`](./_template.md).

## Decision Status

- **Proposed**: Decision proposed but not yet implemented
- **Accepted**: Decision made and implemented
- **Rejected**: Decision considered but rejected
- **Deprecated**: Decision that is no longer relevant
- **Superseded by ADR-XXX**: Decision replaced by another

## Decisions by Category

### Core Framework and Technologies

- **ADR-001**: Playwright as the main automation framework
- **ADR-002**: TypeScript strict mode for type safety

### System Architecture

- **ADR-003**: Multi-cinema structure with separate namespaces

## Planned Future Decisions

### Q4 2024 - Q1 2025

- **ADR-004**: CI/CD strategy and deployment pipeline
- **ADR-005**: API testing integration implementation
- **ADR-006**: Visual regression testing approach

### Q1 2025 - Q2 2025

- **ADR-007**: Mobile testing strategy and responsive validation
- **ADR-008**: Performance testing integration
- **ADR-009**: Test data management and synthetic data generation

## Process for New ADRs

### When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR when:

- Making an architectural decision that will be difficult to reverse
- The decision affects multiple system components
- There are multiple viable options with significant trade-offs
- The decision requires justification for future reference
- Teams or stakeholders need to understand the decision context

### How to Create an ADR

1. **Copy the template**: Use [`_template.md`](./_template.md) as a base
2. **Assign number**: Use the next sequential number (ADR-004, ADR-005, etc.)
3. **Complete all sections**: Especially context, alternatives, and consequences
4. **Request review**: At least 2 reviews before marking as "Accepted"
5. **Update this index**: Add the corresponding entry
6. **Communicate the decision**: Share with the team and relevant stakeholders

### Filename Template

```text
XXXX-brief-decision-title.md
```

Examples:

- `0004-cicd-pipeline-strategy.md`
- `0005-api-testing-integration.md`
- `0006-visual-regression-approach.md`

## Writing Guidelines

### Clear Context

- Explain **why** the decision is necessary
- Provide sufficient background for newcomers to understand
- Include relevant technical and business constraints

### Detailed Alternatives

- List **all** seriously considered options
- Explain pros and cons objectively
- Provide clear rationale for why other options were rejected

### Honest Consequences

- Include both positive and negative consequences
- Be realistic about trade-offs and limitations
- Consider long-term implications

### Practical Implementation

- Provide actionable implementation steps
- Define success criteria clearly
- Include rollback plan when appropriate
