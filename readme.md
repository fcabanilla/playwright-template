# Feature Request: Add README.md

## Description

Currently, the `playwright-templete` repository lacks a `README.md` file. A properly structured README will help new users understand the purpose of the project, its setup process, and how to use it.

## Task Details

- Create a `README.md` file in the project's root directory.
- Include the following sections:
  - **Project Overview**: A brief introduction to the project and its purpose.
  - **Features**: Key features of the template (Playwright, TypeScript, Allure, etc.).
  - **Installation**: Steps to clone the repository, install dependencies, and set up Playwright.
  - **Project Structure**: A directory structure overview.
  - **Usage**: Instructions on how to run tests and generate reports.
  - **Continuous Integration**: Explanation of GitHub Actions integration.
  - **Contributing**: Guidelines for contributing to the project.
  - **License**: Information about the projectâ€™s license.

## Acceptance Criteria

- A well-structured `README.md` is added to the repository.
- The README clearly explains the project's setup and usage.
- The file follows proper markdown formatting and is free of typos.

## Additional Notes

This documentation will improve project onboarding and help maintain consistency for future contributors.
