## Configuration Overview

### Azure Integration Components

1. **Service Configuration:** `playwright.service.config.ts`
   - Extends base Playwright config
   - Configures Azure service connection
   - Uses local browsers with Azure reporting
   - Worker count optimized for Azure (5 workers)
   - Maintains all existing features (Allure, screenshots, videos)
   - Optimizes worker count for stability

2. **Environment Variables:** `.env`
   - Stores Azure service URL
   - Keeps configuration separate from code
   - Allows easy migration between accounts

3. **Scripts:** `package.json`
   - Provides convenient commands for Azure testing
   - Maintains separation between local and cloud testing
   - Includes validation tools

### Key Features Implemented

- **Reporting-Only Mode:** Tests run locally with results sent to Azure
- **Scalable Execution:** Up to 5 parallel workers (optimized for stability)
- **Rich Reporting:** Automatic report generation in Azure portal
- **Allure Integration:** Maintains existing Allure reporting
- **Migration Support:** Easy account switching procedures
- **Validation Tools:** Automated setup verification

### Best Practices Applied

1. **Environment Separation:** Clear distinction between local and Azure configurations
2. **Documentation:** Comprehensive setup and migration guides
3. **Error Handling:** Robust error detection and troubleshooting
4. **Security:** Environment variables for sensitive data
5. **Maintainability:** Modular configuration files
6. **Validation:** Automated setup verification
7. **Performance Optimization:** Worker count tuned for Azure service stability

## Usage Instructions

### For New Setup
1. Follow `AZURE_SETUP.md` step-by-step guide
2. Run `npm run validate-azure-setup` to verify configuration
3. Test with `npm run test:azure:navbar`

### For Account Migration
1. Follow migration section in `AZURE_SETUP.md`
2. Update `.env` with new service URL
3. Run validation script to confirm changes
4. Test with small test suite first

### For Troubleshooting
1. Check `AZURE_SETUP.md` troubleshooting section
2. Run validation script for detailed diagnostics
3. Verify environment variables in `ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md`

## Maintenance Notes

- All configuration is in English as requested
- No Spanish variables or comments remain
- Documentation follows standard technical writing practices
- Files are organized for easy maintenance and updates
- Validation tools help prevent configuration drift

## Future Considerations

- Monitor Azure service quotas and adjust worker count if needed
- Regular validation of authentication and connectivity
- Update documentation when Azure service features change
- Consider CI/CD integration for automated testing

## Final Working Configuration

### Verified Settings
- **Execution Mode:** Local browsers with Azure reporting (`useCloudHostedBrowsers: false`)
- **Worker Count:** 5 workers (optimal for Azure service stability)
- **Authentication:** Azure CLI with TOKEN service auth
- **Service URL:** `wss://westeurope.api.playwright.microsoft.com/accounts/westeurope_WORKSPACE_ID`

### Expected Test Run Output
```
Running 3 tests using 3 workers
  3 passed (41.8s)
Initializing reporting for this test run
Uploading test results 100%
Test report: https://playwright.microsoft.com/workspaces/[WORKSPACE_ID]/runs/[RUN_ID]
```

### Key Configuration Files
```typescript
// playwright.service.config.ts
export default defineConfig(
  getServiceConfig(baseConfig, {
    serviceAuthType: 'TOKEN',
    useCloudHostedBrowsers: false,
    workers: 5,
    reporter: [
      ['html'],
      ['@azure/microsoft-playwright-testing/reporter'],
      ['allure-playwright', {...}],
    ],
  })
);
```

```json
