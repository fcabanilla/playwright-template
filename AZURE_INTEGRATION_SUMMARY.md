   - Keeps configuration separate from code
   - Allows easy migration between accounts

3. **Scripts:** `package.json`
   - Provides convenient commands for Azure testing
   - Maintains separation between local and cloud testing
   - Includes validation tools

### Key Features Implemented

- **Cloud Browser Testing:** Tests run on Azure-hosted browsers
- **Scalable Execution:** Up to 5 parallel workers (configurable)
- **Rich Reporting:** Automatic report generation in Azure portal
- **Allure Integration:** Maintains existing Allure reporting
- **Migration Support:** Easy account switching procedures
- **Validation Tools:** Automated setup verification

### Best Practices Applied

2. **Documentation:** Comprehensive setup and migration guides
3. **Error Handling:** Robust error detection and troubleshooting
4. **Security:** Environment variables for sensitive data
5. **Maintainability:** Modular configuration files
6. **Validation:** Automated setup verification

## Usage Instructions

### For New Setup
